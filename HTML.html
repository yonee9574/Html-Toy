  <p>Hello every one This web site <strong><u>Travel</u> lover</strong> site.
  </p><p>Hello, this group of people who love traveling, 'Yeo Samo'.
  We are a website that shares travel knowledge.</p>
  <p>How did you come up with this page?
  I've always liked traveling and my heart is pounding when
  <p>I think about it now.
  But if you look it up on the internet,</p>
   <p>there's a lot of information,
   but there aren't many travel information sites in Korean.</p>
  (a lot of weird sites out there.)
  I really wanted to create sites that only made
  information about travel so
   that it would not be uncomfortable to see.</p>
